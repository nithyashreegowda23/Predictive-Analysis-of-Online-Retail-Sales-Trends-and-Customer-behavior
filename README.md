This repository contains the final project submitted for the completion of my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science. The project focuses on using real-world data and advanced data analytics techniques.

The aim of this project was to:

Conduct thorough data preprocessing and exploratory analysis

Apply machine learning models for prediction/classification/forecasting

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Derive actionable insights to support business or research objectives

 Key Components:
Data Cleaning and Transformation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Predictive Modeling (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Time Series Forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet)

Association Rule Mining

Customer Segmentation (e.g., RFM Analysis, K-Means Clustering)
